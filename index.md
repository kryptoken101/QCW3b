## QCW3B: e-Governance Platform 

You can use [Thirdweb SDK](https://thirdweb.com) to customize and build web3 apps easily.

This is a blockchain-based project intended to ensure transparency, reliability and data security. The development outline is likewise focused in providing a remunerative ecosystem for all users and the community. You mauy utilize [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to write, import, compile, deploy and run Solidity contracts.

### Kaizen 
 
QCW3b transcends the limits of enterprise management and the provision of socio-civic services within a local government unit. It primarily melds the advances and benefits of blockchain technology and web 3.0 framework towards a streamlined and cost-efficient business workflow.

Concurrent Environment

At present, there is no comprehensive information system to administer Quezon City Social Services programs, grants and services. Rather, the current systems are mainly paper-based and manual. Due to the nature of the services offered Quezon City Social Services would require integration with other existing systems, some of these systems currently exist and some will be provisioned in the future.
